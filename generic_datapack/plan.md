hotbar.0 = jetpack
hotbar.1 = lazer
hotbar.2 = toggle floodlight
hotbar.3 = fire inflatable drill
hotbar.4 = environment scan
hotbar.5 = block filler
hotbar.6 = toggle between multi-fire tnt and guided tnt
hotbar.7 = feet smash
hotbar.8 = gravity cannon

q = fire tnt/missile
f = toggle between maver mode and titan mode

Block Filler shoots out gravity affected blocks

Hover mode (out of water) will only be available for a limited time
and requires a battery recharge after a while to not make it overpowered

Maver mode = submarine/hover mode

Move more freely with camera in water
